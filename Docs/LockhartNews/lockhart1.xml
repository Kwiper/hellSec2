<posting title="Chemicals: A Cause of Homosexuality?">
A stunning new study from researchers over at China has revealed that a certain chemical may lead to homosexuality in people.

Serotonin is the chemical responsible for an organism's growth, reproduction or mood (among other things). Researchers in Georgia have revealed that serotonin levels have a direct correlation with mice's sexuality.

We asked some local people how they feel about this discovery.

"So what you're saying is I can turn my best friend gay?" said one man.
"I've always wanted to become a lesbian so I could be with my lesbian friend!" said one woman.
"I knew it, chemicals are responsible for turning the frigging frogs gay!" said another man.
"I don't care, I'm already gay," said another woman.

Where this discovery will lead, we can only guess.</posting>
