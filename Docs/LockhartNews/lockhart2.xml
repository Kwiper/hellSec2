<posting title="Santa is Real">
Many children around the world grew up with the story of Santa Claus, a fat man in a red and white outfit with a rosy nose and snowy beard. As adults, we've all dismissed Santa as just a story we tell to children to make them behave.
But should that really be the case?

People around the world claimed to have spotted an unidentified flying object on Christmas Eve. Those same people woke up the next morning to find coal in their stockings.
Is this the work of a prankster, or is Santa Claus really making a list and checking it twice? 

We at Lockhart only report what is real, and we can say for sure that this proves Santa Claus is real.</posting>
