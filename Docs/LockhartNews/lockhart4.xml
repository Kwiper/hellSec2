<posting title="Surtists Are Not Happy About Christmas Lights">
Sweden has banned Christmas lights to avoid angering Surtist refugees.

This report came from an anonymous source on Facenook after news that Sweden would no longer allow local municipalities to adorn the streets with Christmas lights came to light.
After the real source of this ban came to light, public backlash against the Surtist community sparked all over the world.

We at Lockhart hope Sweden finds a way to fix this scandal, and wholeheartedly believe that the Surtist community is not in the wrong.</posting>
