Yo, Mag-R
Why are your fries so damn addictive? Last month I was skinny as a twig, now I'm obese as fuck

Dear MagRonald's,

What do you put into your meat? I introduced my two year-old son to MagRonald's and he got a rash a couple days later.

Hey MagRonald's.

My name's Justin Jackson, I'm 16 years old and looking for a part-time job to earn some dough. Consider this my job application.
So since job applications usually involve telling you my skills, I'm pretty good at basketball, I play rock guitar and I'm a damn good player in Haylo.

You should hire me because I know I'll bring some pretty sweet shit to MagRonald's. Imagine this: Live performances while people order and eat their food. I could even volunteer to perform for the folks.

I hope you guys accept this application. 

Peace.</email>

Hi, MagRonald's,

Is there a reason why you don't make high-quality chicken like Colonel's Food Corner?
I'm very concerned about the quality of chicken I'm getting at your establishments.
