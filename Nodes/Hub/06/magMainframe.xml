MagRonald's was founded in 1939 by Magnus Ronald after he found out how to make fried potatoes taste addicting in a short period of time.
Building on this premise, Ronald created a delicious menu of a "classic American meal" with one goal in mind: making the food as addicting as possible.
Today, MagRonald's is a global juggernaut in the fast food industry, with thousands of branches around the globe. MagRonald's goal remains unchanged from Magnus Ronald's original dream.</encryptedFile>
