<body>#PLAYERNAME#,
It should go without saying that revenge porn is not ok. It's a huge breach of privacy, and people should only share their nudes or sex tapes when they want to.
A client has contacted us with this very issue. After a nasty breakup, the client's ex-boyfriend posted images of her nude on Facenook. She's asked us to access his Facenook and delete every single one of those images.
Her ex-boyfriend's name is Riley Heathcliffe
This is a pretty serious matter.

Good luck,
