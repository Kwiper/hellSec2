<body>#PLAYERNAME#,
A company that specializes in security software development has requested that we find the email password of one of their employees.
They are worried that she is engaging in... questionable activities, and it is affecting her productivity.
They have provided a link to the employee's workstation. I will also give you a link to the company's web server.

Good luck,
-Quartz</body>
