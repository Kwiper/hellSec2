Never have we been recognized by law enforcement like this. Our work must have garnered a positive reception now.
Anywho, this police precinct has asked us to find evidence pertaining to a drug bust case they're working on.
They want us to find evidence that proves a certain target will be involved in a drug deal going down soon.
They've linked us to the target's last known location. If you can find any evidence, upload it to the drop server.
