<body>#PLAYERNAME#,
A client wants some medical records of a patient. The patient's name is Jessica Killian.
The client has requested that we give them the name of the patient's perscription.
I've linked you to the Universal Medical Database. You should be able to find the perscription from there. 
Reply to this email with the name.
