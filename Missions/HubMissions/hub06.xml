<body>Alright, #PLAYERNAME#,
This client's asked us for a strange one, but to be honest, I'm quite curious myself.
You heard about how CFC's secret ingredients list got leaked? Well, this time we're going after famous fast food chain MagRonald's.
Your job is to investigate MagRonald's and find their list of ingredients. Once you find it, upload it to the drop server.

This is making me hungry.
