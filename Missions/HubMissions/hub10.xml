I've never liked job hunting. That's why I became a hacker. It's fun. It's fulfilling.
This client needs help posting their job application to a company who won't even consider him.
Uploading the CV to the company's CEO's computer should do the trick. The client has provided his application, and I've uploaded it to the drop server for you.

Good luck,
