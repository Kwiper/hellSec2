<body>Alright, #PLAYERNAME#,
This client got scammed by someone on the black market. They've asked us to trace the guy and erase what he took off of the client.
The item is in a .zip file, and it's called "Vertigo"
Apparently this guy runs a message board where people go to put in requests. You should be able to trace him from there.
I've uploaded two new programs for you to use to the drop server. They should help you in finding this guy.

Happy hunting,
-Quartz</body>
