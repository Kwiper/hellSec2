<body>#PLAYERNAME#,
I'm sure you've heard of Lockhart News. They're quite famous, well, infamous, for being the number one source of false information.
Problem is, of course, it's not satire. And people buy into this stuff. Obviously, fake news is an issue everywhere, but recently, Lockhart has taken things quite far.
Their influence on people is scary.
Your job is shut down Lockhart, at least until they learn their lesson. I'll link you to Lockhart's news site. Find your way to their central server, delete their /sys folder.
Happy hunting,
