A client has asked us to track down the transaction number of a Bytecoin transfer he made. Apparently he's having second thoughts transferring the coin.
They've linked us to the Bytecoin wallet service they used. They go by the handle Connect.
Find Connect's transaction number. Apparently it was the only transaction he's ever made. Reply here with the number.
