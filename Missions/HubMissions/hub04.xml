<body>Alright, #PLAYERNAME#.
A client wants us to remove all traces of their academic records. Seems they want to just disappear.
Can't say I blame them. There are times when I want to go off the grid.
Anyways, the client's name is Trenton Riker. I'll link you to the Academic Archives.
Find some way to access the archives. Delete Trenton Riker's academic records.
