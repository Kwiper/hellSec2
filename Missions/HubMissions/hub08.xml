<body>#PLAYERNAME#,
There was an innocent man on Death Row. A client has asked us to remove his record from the database.
The client has said they don't want his memory tainted, so they would like his Death Row record removed.
The target's name is Jamie Acasio.
I'll link you to the Death Row Database. I've also provided a new program for you to use. I've uploaded it onto the drop server.

Good luck,
-Quartz</body>
