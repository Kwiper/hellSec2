<body>That must have caught you off guard.
Don't worry about it, you were unprepared. I took him down for you. And took down the rest of his network. I don't think he'll be able to bring back Project M after this.
While I was dealing with the last of his nodes, I stumbled upon something interesting that you may like. I'll link it to you in this email.

Till next time,
