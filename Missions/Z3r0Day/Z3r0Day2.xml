<body>#PLAYERNAME#, what a surprise.
Then again, I shouldn't be surprised you found my node and downloaded that secret message. So, you want to take part in this little mission?
Rhetorical question, you wouldn't have downloaded the file if you didn't want to. To business.
Remember Morpheus? He was... an old colleague, and a former adversary. You may also remember he used to work on Project M with me. I thought I was done with Project M, but it seems that's not the case.
Morpheus has been trying to resurrect Project M, under the name Remnant M. This is the perfect opportunity to take care of Morpheus and Project M for the last time. 
I've already dealt with some of his nodes. I want you to take a look at one. Infiltrate it, and delete everything. Even files not related to Project M. Everything.

I'll be counting on you,
Z3r0</body>
