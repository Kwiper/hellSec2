<body>I imagine that was quite a surprise for you.
That should be the end of Morpheus. I don't think he'll be able to bring back Project M after this. Thank you, #PLAYERNAME#, for your help in taking him down.
While I was dealing with the last of his nodes, I stumbled upon something interesting that you may like. I'll link it to you in this email.

Till next time,
